								<h3>What is Chillr? </h3>
								<p>Chillr is a smartphone application that allows immediate transfer of money to friends in your phone book in an easy & secure manner.</p>
								<h3>Does Chillr work with all banks in India? </h3>
								<p>Chillr works with all banks that have IMPS enabled. Chillr is now available for all customers of CSB. As a CSB customer, you can also transfer money to your contacts having other bank accounts. </p>
								<h3>Do I have to transfer money from my bank account into a wallet? </h3>
								<p>No, there are no virtual wallets here. Chillr lets you make transactions directly from your CSB account. So it is not only convenient, but your money is always in trusted hands. Since you don't have to make frequent trips to your ATM to withdraw cash, you tend to earn more interest income as more money stays with your bank. </p>
								<h3>Can I transfer money to an account in another bank? </h3>
								<p>Yes. You can send money to any other Chillr user not limiting to the bank account the recipient is connected with. </p>
								<h3>Do I need a specific mobile service provider? </h3>
								<p>Chillr works on any mobile service provider. All you need is a working internet connection on your smartphone (2G/EGDE/3G/HSPA/Wi-Fi) </p>
								<h3>Is Chillr free? </h3>
								<p>Downloading of Chillr App is free. CSB does not charge its customers for transactions on Chillr. </p>

								<h3>How fast is Chillr? </h3>

								<h3>Can I send money to someone even if I don't have their mobile number? </h3>

The ''Near Me'' feature will help you find other Chillr users near you. However you will need to turn on location services on your smartphone to be able to do this. Android version 1.12 and above includes a QR code generator and scanner which can be used to make a transaction with a user near you without having your location services on.</p>
								<h3>How safe is Chillr? </h3>

								<h3>What if I lose my phone? </h3>

								<h3>What if I change my mobile number? </h3>
								<p>When you change your mobile number please visit the nearest CSB Branch to update your mobile number. Once updated, generate your new MMID and give request for new MPIN at Phone Banking. You can start using Chillr by resetting account under settings and then register again with new details. If you change your mobile number a notification will also be sent to your friends on Chillr which they can use to update their phonebook.</p>

								<h3>My recharge transaction was successful but top up didn't happen. What do I do? </h3>
								<p>This is most likely to be an operator issue. In some cases, it can take a few hours for the recharge to happen. Please contact Chillr through the in-app chat or mail your query at support@chillr.in. Rest assured your money is safe & will be returned to your account if recharge does not happen.</p>
								<h3>Can I recharge for my friends? </h3>
								<p>Of course you can! Just enter the phone number, operator and the amount to be recharged. You can authenticate the transaction using your M-PIN. Frequent recharges are saved for you to easily recharge next time!</p>
								<h3>What if I recharge the wrong number? </h3>
								<p>Unfortunately, Chillr cannot help you with this as the amount would have already been credited to the other person. We suggest that you select numbers from your contact list to avoid mistakes.</p>

								<p>Yes. You can add your other account as a beneficiary and transfer money to this account from your bank account linked to Chillr.</p>
